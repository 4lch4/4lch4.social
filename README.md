# 4lch4.social

This repo is the home of my socials landing page, with links to my accounts/presence online. It's a simple website created with [Hugo][2] and the [Bootstrap BP Hugo Startpage][3] theme. Instead of using the theme as is, I've [created a fork][4] where I maintain it myself.

## Acknowledgements

- [Hugo][2] - Framework used to build the website.
- [Bootstrap BP Hugo Startpage][3] - The theme used for styling the website.
- [FontAwesome][5] - Provides the icons for the various services/sites.
